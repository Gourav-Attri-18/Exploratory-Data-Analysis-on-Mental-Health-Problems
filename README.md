# **Exploratory Data Analysis on Mental Health Problems**

## **Project Overview**

This project focuses on performing **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on a dataset related to mental health problems. The goal is to uncover insights into the prevalence of mental health issues, factors influencing mental well-being, and the relationship between different demographic and personal attributes. The analysis helps in understanding how various factors such as age, gender, work stress, and social support impact mental health.

## **Objective**

The key objectives of this project include:

- **Prevalence:** Investigating the distribution of mental health issues across different demographics.
- **Factors:** Analyzing factors that influence mental health, such as work-related stress, social support, and lifestyle habits.
- **Trends & Patterns:** Identifying trends and correlations in mental health data to help create awareness and intervention strategies.
- **Insights:** Deriving actionable insights to aid in better mental health strategies and interventions.

## **Dataset**

The dataset used in this project contains information about:

- **Demographic details**: Age, gender, and location.
- **Mental health status**: Whether individuals are affected by mental health problems.
- **Severity**: Severity of mental health issues.
- **Lifestyle factors**: Stress levels, social support, and work-related factors.

## **Key Analysis**

1. **Demographic Analysis**: Examining how mental health issues are distributed across different age groups, genders, and regions.
2. **Correlation Analysis**: Investigating relationships between work stress, social support, and mental health status.
3. **Visualizations**: Visualizing trends using various charts and plots to easily interpret mental health data.
4. **Missing Data Handling**: Identifying missing values and outliers, and applying suitable methods for handling them.

## **Results and Insights**

- **Prevalence Trends**: The analysis highlights which demographic groups are most affected by mental health issues.
- **Factors Impacting Mental Health**: Insights show that work stress and lack of social support are major contributors to mental health problems.
- **Visualization**: Various visualizations such as bar charts, pie charts, and heatmaps were used to effectively convey the findings.
